# Step 1: Data Collection
# Assuming you have a dataset with features (X) and labels (y)
# X is a 2D array of shape (num_samples, 2) representing the coordinates
# y is a 1D array of shape (num_samples,) representing the labels

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Perform any necessary preprocessing steps on X and y

# Step 3: Train-Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Model Training
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Model Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1-score:", f1)

# Step 6: Prediction
# Assuming you have new points in the 2D space that you want to predict
new_points = np.array([[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...])
predictions = model.predict(new_points)
